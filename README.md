## Article: [PSMtags improve peptide sequencing and throughput in sensitive proteomics (Specht et al, 2025)](https://www.biorxiv.org/)

Using combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening, we developed a mass tag, called PSMtag, with the potential to allow simultaneously increasing proteome coverage and sample throughput for DIA workflows without compromising quantitative accuracy.
